# Shroud of the Avatar Lunar Map

I was disappointed there was no in-game Lunar map so I made one.  

Resolution is 2048x2048.

| Name          |   File Size |
|:--------------|------------:|
| lunar_map.png |   3,468,235 |
| lunar_map.xcf |  14,088,572 |

I've included the 14 MB (!) GIMP source file.

Enjoy!
